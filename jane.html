<h1> THE BEAUTIFUL JANE</h1>
    
    <p>THERE once lived, in Fanti-land, a man named Father
Anansi. He possessed all the wisdom in the world.
People came to him daily for advice and help.
One day the men of the country were unfortu-
nate enough to offend Father Anansi, who immedi-
ately resolved to punish them. After much thought he
decided that the severest penalty he could inflict would
be to hide all his wisdom from them. He set to work at
once to gather again all that he had already given.
When he had succeeded, as he thought, in collecting it,
he placed all in one great pot. This he carefully sealed,
and determined to put it in a spot where no human be-
        ing could reach it.</p><p><img src="img/img8.jpg">
Now, Father Anansi had a son, whose name
was Kweku Tsin. This boy began to suspect his father
of some secret design, so he made up his mind to
watch carefully. Next day he saw his father quietly slip
out of the house, with his precious pot hung round his
neck. Kweku Tsin followed. Father Anansi went
through the forest till he had left the village far behind.
        Then, selecting the highest and most inaccessible
    one but himself. He was unable, however, to carry out
his desire. At each trial the pot swung in his way.
For some time Kweku Tsin watched his father’s
vain attempts. At last, unable to contain himself any
longer, he cried out: “Father, why do you not hang the
pot on your back? Then you could easily climb the
tree.”
Father Anansi turned and said: “I thought I had
all the world’s wisdom in this pot. But I find you pos-
sess more than I do. All my wisdom was insufficient to
show me what to do, yet you have been able to tell
me.” In his anger he threw the pot down. It struck on
a great rock and broke. The wisdom contained in it es-
caped and spread throughout the world.
